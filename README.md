This repository contains all the files in the Web release for [Ken's Quest 2's MVP](https://sebeldev.itch.io/kens-quest-2-mvp), a game I created.
It is the **minimum viable product** for the full game. I would recommend checking out the itch.io page rather than playing it here. The purpose of this repository is to easily embed the game wherever I want.
You can embed this game yourself using [this link](https://sebeldev.github.io/Ken2MVP/)!
